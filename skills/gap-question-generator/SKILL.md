# gap-question-generator

## Purpose
Identifies 5-7 critical questions that stakeholders must answer to reduce ambiguity and risk.

## Input
- Normalized requirement from requirement-normalizer
- Known risks from input schema

## Process

### Step 1: Question Categorization
Generate questions across 6 critical categories:

**1. Requirement Clarity** (1-2 questions)
- What is NOT changing? (scope boundaries)
- What business processes will users follow? (workflow detail)
- Are there special cases or exceptions? (edge cases)

**2. Technical Feasibility** (1-2 questions)
- Which SAP modules/systems are involved? (scope confirmation)
- Are there custom code, interfaces, or data migrations? (complexity)
- What is the target SAP version and landscape? (architecture)

**3. Timeline & Resources** (1 question)
- Who will implement this and are they available? (resource commitment)
- What is the realistic timeline given other priorities? (dependency check)

**4. Risk Awareness** (1-2 questions)
- What could go wrong that we haven't mentioned? (hidden risks)
- Has this been tried before, and what was learned? (organizational memory)

**5. Dependency Management** (0-1 questions)
- Are there other changes this depends on? (sequencing)

**6. Success Definition** (0-1 questions)
- How will we measure success post-go-live? (long-term value)

### Step 2: Question Prioritization

**Critical** (must answer before proceeding):
- Questions that unlock requirements clarity or unblock technical decisions
- Questions about resource availability or timeline
- Questions about show-stopper risks

**High** (should answer soon):
- Questions that reduce risk or improve quality
- Questions about stakeholder alignment
- Performance or compliance concerns

**Medium** (nice to have):
- Questions that optimize implementation
- Questions about future enhancements
- Questions about operational readiness

**Low** (can defer):
- Questions that don't affect GO/NO-GO decision
- Questions answerable during implementation

### Step 3: Question Framing

Each question should:
- Be answerable (not rhetorical)
- Be specific (not vague)
- Reference evidence from requirement or context
- State why the answer matters (impact)

**Template**:
```
Q[#] - [Question Category]: [Specific Question]?

Evidence: [Why we don't know this from the requirement]
Impact: [What depends on the answer]
Priority: [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
```

## Example Output

```
# Open Questions for CHG-2026-001

## Q1 - Requirement Clarity: CRITICAL
**Question**: The requirement mentions "migrate to S/4HANA Cloud" but doesn't specify Public, Private, or Hybrid Cloud - which are we targeting?

**Evidence**: Input states "cloud instance" but SAP offers multiple deployment options with different feature sets and compliance implications.

**Impact**: Deployment choice affects timeline (Public = fastest, Private = 6-12 months), cost model, and available features. Critical for architecture decision.

**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## Q2 - Technical Feasibility: CRITICAL
**Question**: The requirement mentions custom ABAP code exists in current ECC system - do we know what percentage of our codebase is custom vs. standard SAP?

**Evidence**: Input mentions "leverage SAP standard processes where possible" implying some custom code exists, but no inventory provided.

**Impact**: Custom code analysis determines migration effort. >50% custom code may make cloud migration infeasible or require significant rewrite.

**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## Q3 - Timeline & Resources: HIGH
**Question**: Who specifically will lead the implementation, and are they available full-time starting [proposed start date]?

**Evidence**: Project manager role identified in 10-project-context.md but resource commitment unknown. Previous projects delayed due to resource constraints.

**Impact**: Implementation timeline depends entirely on available skilled resources. Part-time resources extend timeline 30-50%.

**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Q4 - Risk Awareness: HIGH
**Question**: We identified performance risk for integrations with legacy systems - has this organization successfully migrated to cloud while maintaining integrations with [specific legacy systems] before?

**Evidence**: 20-domain-knowledge.md notes integration patterns as common risk. No organizational precedent mentioned in 10-project-context.md.

**Impact**: If no precedent exists, load testing and proof-of-concept integration required (adds 4-8 weeks and 100+ hours).

**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Q5 - Dependency Management: HIGH
**Question**: The CHG-2026-002 (Data quality cleansing project) is listed as a dependency - what is its current status and committed completion date?

**Evidence**: Normalized requirement identified CHG-2026-002 as a blocking dependency.

**Impact**: This change cannot start data migration phase until data quality work completes. Serializes timeline.

**Priority**: HIGH

---

## Q6 - Success Definition: MEDIUM
**Question**: Beyond the functional acceptance criteria, what does success look like 6 months post-go-live? Are there operational metrics or user adoption targets?

**Evidence**: Requirement focuses on go-live but doesn't address operational excellence or change adoption metrics.

**Impact**: Helps define realistic post-implementation support and optimization phase.

**Priority**: MEDIUM

---

## Q7 - Compliance & Governance: CRITICAL
**Question**: Are there regulatory or compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOX, industry-specific) that affect how we design the cloud solution?

**Evidence**: 00-governance.md lists compliance frameworks but requirement doesn't mention which apply to this change.

**Impact**: Compliance choice affects architecture, data residency, audit requirements, and go-live readiness checks.

**Priority**: CRITICAL
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - Each question references specific requirement gaps  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output matches open_questions structure in output.schema.json  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - All critical gaps are stated as questions  
✅ **Gate: Risk Transparency** - Questions are prioritized by business impact  

## Red Flags (Escalate to gap-question-generator refinement)
- Questions that are answerable from requirement (move to assumed)
- Questions that are about implementation details (defer to later phases)
- Questions without clear priority or impact statement

## Implementation Notes
- Use 00-governance.md for compliance framework questions
- Use 20-domain-knowledge.md for technical feasibility questions
- Use 10-project-context.md for resource and organizational context
- Aim for 5-7 questions total (not more, not fewer)
- Prioritize ruthlessly - only CRITICAL and HIGH questions block go/no-go
