# testcase-designer

## Purpose
Creates comprehensive test cases that verify all acceptance criteria are met and all risks have been tested.

## Input
- Normalized requirement from requirement-normalizer
- Impact analysis including risk matrix from impact-analyzer
- Acceptance criteria from requirement-normalizer

## Process

### Step 1: Test Coverage Planning

Map acceptance criteria to test case categories:

**Unit Tests** (Component-level):
- Individual configuration validated
- Custom code functions tested
- Data transformations verified

**Integration Tests** (System-to-system):
- Interfaces working correctly
- Master data mappings accurate
- Real-time synchronization functional

**System Tests** (End-to-end processes):
- Complete business processes flow end-to-end
- All system interactions validated
- Performance meets requirements

**User Acceptance Tests** (Business process):
- Users can complete their daily work
- Reports and dashboards work correctly
- User workflows unchanged or improved

**Regression Tests** (No breakage):
- Existing unchanged functionality still works
- Baseline report values unchanged
- Historical data accessible

**Performance Tests** (Load/stress):
- Volume targets (500 POs/day, 10,000+ materials)
- Response time SLAs met
- Batch jobs complete within windows
- Concurrent user load handled

**Security Tests** (Protection):
- Authorization controls work
- Sensitive data masked appropriately
- Audit trails logged
- Encryption in place

### Step 2: Test Case Generation

For each acceptance criterion, generate 3-5 test cases covering:
- **Happy path** (expected scenario)
- **Edge cases** (boundary conditions)
- **Error cases** (invalid input, system failures)
- **Performance case** (high volume)

**Template**:
```
## Test Case: [TC-ID] - [Title]

**Type**: [Unit / Integration / System / UAT / Regression / Performance / Security]

**Scenario**: [Brief description of business scenario]

**Preconditions**:
1. [System state required]
2. [Data required]
3. [Access level required]

**Test Steps**:
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**Expected Result**:
[What should happen if test passes]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

**Risk Addressed**: [Which risk this test mitigates]

**Notes**: [Special considerations, data setup, etc.]
```

### Step 3: Risk-Based Test Planning

For each HIGH or CRITICAL risk from impact-analyzer:
- Create specific test case to validate mitigation
- Include stress/load scenarios if applicable
- Define pass/fail criteria clearly

### Step 4: Test Data Strategy

Specify:
- **Volume**: Production-like volume (e.g., 500 POs)
- **Data Complexity**: Standard cases, edge cases, exceptions
- **Data Lifecycle**: Creation, modification, archival
- **Master Data**: Customer, material, vendor, GL account setup

- ✅ No CRITICAL or blocking issues open
- ✅ Performance tests meet SLA targets
- ✅ Data migration reconciliation signed-off
- ✅ User acceptance sign-off obtained
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - Each test case traces to specific acceptance criterion or risk  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output matches test_cases structure in output.schema.json  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - Gaps in test coverage are explicitly stated  
✅ **Gate: Risk Transparency** - Each test addresses specific identified risk  

## Red Flags (Escalate)
- Acceptance criterion with no test case (incomplete coverage)
- Risk identified in impact-analyzer with no corresponding test (gap)
- Performance test not covering peak load scenario

## Implementation Notes
- Use acceptance criteria from normalized requirement
- Reference risk matrix from impact-analyzer to prioritize tests
- Create test data strategy based on volume projections
- Define clear pass/fail criteria for each test
- Test effort estimate: 15-25% of total implementation effort
