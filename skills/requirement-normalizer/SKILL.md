# requirement-normalizer

## Purpose
Validates, structures, and normalizes raw change requests into clear, unambiguous requirements with explicit in-scope and out-of-scope items.

## Input
- Raw requirement from schemas/input.schema.json

## Process

### Step 1: Requirement Validation
- [ ] Title is specific and descriptive (not vague)
- [ ] Description contains enough detail to understand the change
- [ ] Business context explains WHY (not just WHAT)
- [ ] At least one system or module is identified
- [ ] If business drivers are missing, flag as UNKNOWN

### Step 2: Scope Clarification
- Explicitly separate IN SCOPE from OUT OF SCOPE
- Identify implicit scope creep (e.g., "improve performance" needs definition)
- List dependencies on other changes
- Define system boundaries

### Step 3: Acceptance Criteria Generation
If not provided, generate specific, measurable criteria:
- Functional criteria: "System X produces report Y with accuracy Z%"
- Performance criteria: "Process completes in < N minutes"
- Quality criteria: "Zero critical bugs in UAT"
- User experience: "Average response time < N seconds"

### Step 4: Structured Output

```markdown
# [Change ID] - [Title]

## Normalized Requirement

**Business Value**: [One sentence explaining business value]

**Scope Summary**: [One paragraph of what will change]

**In Scope**:
- Item 1: [Specific description]
- Item 2: [Specific description]

**Out of Scope** (Explicitly excluded):
- Item 1: (because: [reason])
- Item 2: (because: [reason])

**Dependencies Identified**:
- Dependency 1: [Which change, why dependent]
- Dependency 2: [Which change, why dependent]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Functional: [Specific, measurable criterion]
- [ ] Performance: [Specific, measurable criterion]
- [ ] Quality: [Specific, measurable criterion]
- [ ] User Experience: [Specific, measurable criterion]

**Known Unknowns**:
- Unknown 1: [What we don't know yet]
- Unknown 2: [What we don't know yet]
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - Every statement is backed by the input or domain knowledge  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output matches output.schema.json structure  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - All gaps are explicitly stated  
✅ **Gate: Clarity** - A new team member could understand the requirement  

## Red Flags (Escalate to Gap-Question-Generator)
- Vague language: "improve", "optimize", "enhance" without specifics
- Conflicting requirements: "low cost" and "gold-standard solution"
- Missing context: No business drivers or success metrics
- Scope ambiguity: Impossible to determine what "done" means

## Example Output

```
# CHG-2026-001 - Migrate to S/4HANA Cloud

## Normalized Requirement

**Business Value**: Reduce infrastructure costs by 40% and improve system availability from 99% to 99.9%

**Scope Summary**: 
Move from SAP ECC 6.0 on-premise to S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. This includes financial modules (FI, CO), materials management (MM), and sales & distribution (SD), covering all 500+ users across Finance, Supply Chain, and Sales departments.

**In Scope**:
- FI, CO, MM, SD modules migration
- Master data migration (500+ customers, 10,000+ materials)
- Reporting solution migration to SAP Analytics Cloud
- User training and cutover
- Integration with existing non-SAP systems via SAP Cloud Integration

**Out of Scope** (Explicitly excluded):
- HR module (not in initial scope, planned for Phase 2 in 2027)
- Historical data archival (keep on-premise for compliance)
- Custom ABAP code rewrite (use ABAP Cloud where possible, but some legacy features may remain unsupported)

**Dependencies Identified**:
- Depends on: CHG-2026-002 (Data quality cleansing) - must complete before data migration
- Blocks: CHG-2026-003 (Reporting enhancement) - cannot start until BI platform is ready

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Functional: All daily transactions (POs, invoices, orders) process end-to-end in cloud
- [ ] Performance: Average user response time < 2 seconds for standard queries
- [ ] Quality: Zero critical data consistency issues identified in reconciliation
- [ ] User Experience: 95% of users complete training and pass knowledge test

**Known Unknowns**:
- Unknown 1: Final licensing cost for SAP Cloud Services (awaiting SAP estimate)
- Unknown 2: Performance impact of integrations with legacy systems (requires load testing)
- Unknown 3: Custom code feasibility in ABAP Cloud (architecture review needed)
```

## Implementation Notes
- Use the organization context supplied by the change-advisor agent for SAP module interactions
- Reference the organization context supplied by the change-advisor agent for scope classification
- Apply the organization context supplied by the change-advisor agent for output structure
- Capture all unknowns - don't assume information
