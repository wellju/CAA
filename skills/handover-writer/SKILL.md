## Example Output

```markdown
# CHG-2026-001 - S/4HANA Cloud Migration

## Executive Summary

**Change Overview**

This change migrates SAP financial, materials management, and sales systems from SAP ECC 6.0 on-premise to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. The migration reduces infrastructure costs by 40% while improving system availability from 99% to 99.9%, enabling the organization to focus on business transformation rather than infrastructure management.

**Scope**: 3 modules (FI, CO, MM, SD), 500+ users, 3 departments (Finance, Supply Chain, Sales)

**Timeline**: Project Initiation (Q3 2026) → Data Cleansing (Q3-Q4) → Testing & Cutover (Q4 2026) → Go-Live (December 2026)

**Effort**: 600 hours over 6 months across 12-person team

**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH (Risk Score 6/9)

## Recommendation

✅ **CONDITIONAL GO** - Proceed with migration subject to resolution of 4 compliance "Requires Review" items:
1. Data residency compliance (must verify EU data stays in EU datacenters)
2. GDPR data deletion capability (must be built into cloud configuration)
3. SOX IT controls (must be documented and externally audited)
4. SoD remediation (must separate invoice creation from approval role)

Estimated 2-week effort to resolve these conditionals. Do not proceed to CAB review until all 4 are resolved.

## Top 3 Risks

| Risk | Prob | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Custom ABAP code incompatibility with cloud | High | High | 9 | Code assessment (Week 1), SAP CAP training (Week 2-3), legacy feature wrapping as needed |
| Data migration quality issues | Medium | High | 6 | Parallel data cleansing project (CHG-2026-002), reconciliation automation, validation rules |
| Performance degradation on integrations | Medium | Medium | 4 | API standardization, error handling queues, load testing with legacy systems (Week 8-10) |

## Critical Questions for Stakeholders

1. **Q1**: Which specific SAP Cloud deployment are we targeting - Public, Private, or Hybrid Cloud? (Affects timeline, cost, and feature set)
2. **Q2**: What percentage of current ABAP code is custom vs. standard? (>50% custom = significant cloud migration challenges)
3. **Q3**: Who specifically will lead the implementation, and are they available full-time starting Project Initiation? (Timeline depends on resource commitment)

## Key Milestones

- Project Initiation: September 1, 2026
- CAB Approval: September 15, 2026
- Data Cleansing Phase Complete: November 1, 2026
- System Testing Complete: November 20, 2026
- Data Migration Validation Complete: December 15, 2026
- Go-Live: December 23, 2026 (before year-end cutoff)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Normalized Requirement

**Business Value**: Reduce infrastructure costs by 40% and improve system availability from 99% to 99.9%

**Scope Summary**: Move from SAP ECC 6.0 on-premise to S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. Includes financial modules (FI, CO), materials management (MM), and sales & distribution (SD), covering all 500+ users.

**In Scope**:
- FI, CO, MM, SD modules migration
- Master data migration (500+ customers, 10,000+ materials, 1,500+ vendors)
- Reporting solution migration to SAP Analytics Cloud
- User training for 500+ users
- Integration with existing non-SAP systems via SAP Cloud Integration

**Out of Scope**:
- HR module (planned for Phase 2 in 2027)
- Historical data archival (keep on-premise for compliance)
- Complete custom ABAP code rewrite (use SAP Cloud-readiness tools where possible)

**Dependencies**:
- Blocks CHG-2026-003 (Reporting Enhancement)
- Depends on CHG-2026-002 (Data Quality Cleansing)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Functional: All daily transactions (POs, invoices, orders) process end-to-end in cloud
- [ ] Performance: Average user response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Quality: Zero critical data consistency issues
- [ ] User Experience: 95% of users pass training competency test

### 2. Open Questions

**Critical (MUST resolve before CAB approval)**:
- Q1: Public vs. Private vs. Hybrid Cloud deployment?
- Q2: Custom ABAP code inventory and feasibility assessment?
- Q3: Implementation lead resource commitment?
- Q4: Data residency compliance for EU? (GDPR compliance)

**High (Should resolve before implementation)**:
- Q5: Organizational precedent for SAP-to-cloud migrations?
- Q6: Integration proven with legacy systems at this scale?

**Medium**:
- Q7: Post-go-live success metrics and KPIs?

### 3. Impact Analysis

**Risk Matrix Summary**: 7 identified risks, 3 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM

**Affected Systems**:
- SAP ECC 6.0 (being replaced)
- Third-party Legacy Accounting System (integration risk)
- SAP Analytics Cloud (new platform)

**User Impact**:
- Finance (50 users): MEDIUM adoption risk - older demographic
- Supply Chain (200 users): LOW adoption risk - tech-comfortable
- Sales (150 users): LOW adoption risk - minimal workflow change

**Performance**: Month-end close time reduction from 8 hours to 4 hours expected

### 4. Compliance Assessment

| Framework | Status | Risk | Owner | Deadline |
