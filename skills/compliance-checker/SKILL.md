# compliance-checker

## Purpose
Validates the proposed change against SAP governance frameworks and regulatory requirements to ensure compliance or identify mitigation strategies.

## Input
- Normalized requirement from requirement-normalizer
- Business context from input schema
- Open questions from gap-question-generator

## Process

### Step 1: Applicable Framework Identification

Determine which compliance frameworks apply:

**Mandatory Frameworks**:
- SAP Best Practices (always applies)
- Governance & Change Control (always applies)
- Security & Data Protection (always applies)

**Context-Dependent Frameworks**:
- GDPR: If personal data is processed
- SOX: If financial systems are affected
- GxP (FDA): If regulated manufacturing
- HIPAA: If healthcare data
- ISO 27001: If security enhancement requested

### Step 2: Framework Compliance Assessment

For each applicable framework:

**Check 1**: Architecture Alignment
- Does proposed solution align with SAP best practices for this domain?
- Does it follow recommended patterns from the organization context supplied by the change-advisor agent?
- Are there design decisions conflicting with governance?

**Check 2**: Change Control Alignment
- Does this require CAB review per the organization context supplied by the change-advisor agent?
- Is scope classification (Standard/Significant/Major) correct?
- Are all go/no-go criteria from governance framework met?

**Check 3**: Data & Security
- Does this require data classification review?
- Are PII, PHI, or sensitive financial data affected?
- Does authentication/authorization align with security policies?
- Is encryption required and implemented?

**Check 4**: Audit & Compliance
- Are audit trails required for this change?
- Does this require regulatory reporting (SOX, GDPR)?
- Are segregation of duties (SoD) conflicts possible?

**Check 5**: Performance & Availability
- Does this align with SLA requirements?
- Is resilience/redundancy adequate?
- Are backup/disaster recovery plans updated?

### Step 3: Compliance Verdict

For each check:
- **Status**: Compliant / Non-Compliant / Requires Review / N/A
- **Details**: What was verified and result
- **Required Evidence**: Documentation needed for sign-off
- **Action Items**: If non-compliant, remediation steps with owner and deadline

### Step 4: Risk Summary

- **Compliance Risk Score**: Low (0-1 issues) / Medium (2-3 issues) / High (4+ issues)
- **Blockers**: Any compliance issues that must be resolved before go-live
- **Conditionals**: Issues that can be mitigated with additional controls
- **Recommendations**: Best practices that improve robustness

## Framework 2: Change Control & Governance

**Check**: Scope classification and CAB review requirements

**Status**: ⚠️  REQUIRES REVIEW

**Details**: 
- Estimated effort: 400-600 hours (falls under MAJOR scope per governance)
- Systems affected: 3 (ECC → S/4HANA, integrations with legacy systems)
- Cross-department impact: 500+ users across Finance, Supply Chain, Sales
- Governance policy requires: Executive sponsor sign-off, CAB review, 30-day change window communication

**Required Evidence**:
- [ ] Executive sponsor letter confirming business case and budget
- [ ] CAB pre-review meeting scheduled (minimum 4 weeks before cutover)
- [ ] Stakeholder communication plan completed
- [ ] Risk mitigation plan approved by CAB

**Action Items**:
- [OWNER: Project Sponsor] Schedule CAB pre-review meeting by [DATE]
- [OWNER: Project Manager] Prepare CAB submission package by [DATE]
- [OWNER: Communications] Execute 30-day advance notice by [DATE]

## Framework 3: Security & Data Protection

**Check 1**: Data Classification & Sensitivity

**Status**: ⚠️  REQUIRES REVIEW

**Details**:
- Proposed cloud environment processes: Customer master data, vendor master data, invoice data (Financial PII risk)
- Current state: On-premise, SAP security perimeter
- New state: SAP cloud, vendor-managed security

Questions requiring review:
- Are all data elements classified for sensitivity?
- Are retention policies aligned with cloud provider's defaults?
- Is data residency requirement met by public cloud deployment?

**Required Evidence**:
- [ ] Data classification matrix (all fields identified as Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted)
- [ ] Data residency compliance document (EU data stays in EU datacenters)
- [ ] Encryption-in-transit and encryption-at-rest confirmation
- [ ] Vendor NDA and security audit results

**Action Items**:
- [OWNER: Data Governance] Complete data classification by [DATE]
- [OWNER: Compliance] Verify data residency with SAP cloud provider by [DATE]
- [OWNER: Security] Review SAP Cloud security audit results by [DATE]

**Check 2**: Authentication & Authorization

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

**Details**: 
- Proposed: SAP cloud will use company's Azure Active Directory (AAD) for SSO
- Current: SAP Users managed locally in ECC
- Migration: User sync from AD to SAP Cloud Identity Services

Verification: Azure AD integration for SAP cloud is pre-certified and uses OAuth 2.0 standard protocol. No custom authentication code required.

**Required Evidence**:
- [ ] Azure AD connector configuration tested
- [ ] User sync mapping rules validated
- [ ] Initial user load test completed (500+ users)

**Action Items**: None - verified during proof-of-concept

**Check 3**: Segregation of Duties (SoD)

**Status**: ⚠️  NON-COMPLIANT - REQUIRES REMEDIATION

**Details**:
- Current state: Finance user "FIN-MGR-001" has authority to create invoices AND approve invoices (SoD violation)
- Proposed state: Cloud system has stronger SoD controls, but configuration must be set correctly

This is not new - it's a governance gap in current system. Cloud migration is an opportunity to fix.

**Required Evidence**:
- [ ] Current SoD violation report with business justification
- [ ] Cloud security configuration preventing FIN-MGR-001 from approving own invoices
- [ ] Finance process change to separate approvers
- [ ] Audit firm sign-off on remediated SoD

**Action Items**:
- [OWNER: Finance Director] Approve SoD remediation process change by [DATE]

- Current state: On-premise ECC, so DPA not required
- New state: Cloud = processor relationship requiring formal DPA

**Required Evidence**:
- [ ] SAP Data Processing Agreement obtained and reviewed
- [ ] Legal review of DPA terms

## Compliance Summary

| Framework | Status | Risk Level | Blocker? | Owner |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| SAP Best Practices | ✅ Compliant | Low | No | Finance Director |
| Change Control | ⚠️ Requires Review | Medium | Conditional | Project Manager |
| Data Classification | ⚠️ Requires Review | Medium | Conditional | Data Governance |
| GDPR Compliance | ⚠️ Requires Review | Medium | Conditional | Legal/DPO |
| SOX Compliance | ⚠️ Requires Review | Medium | Conditional | Internal Audit |

**Overall Compliance Risk**: MEDIUM - 4 frameworks require review, but no show-stopper blockers

**Go/No-Go Impact**: CONDITIONAL GO - All "Requires Review" items must be resolved before cutover

**Sign-Off Required From**:
- [ ] Finance Director (SAP best practices)
- [ ] Project Sponsor (Governance/CAB)
- [ ] Chief Information Security Officer (Data/GDPR)
- [ ] General Counsel (Legal/SOX)
- [ ] Chief Audit Officer (SOX compliance)
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - Each compliance check references specific governance policy or regulatory requirement  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output matches compliance_checks structure in output.schema.json  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - All compliance gaps are explicitly stated as "Requires Review"  
✅ **Gate: Risk Transparency** - Compliance risks are clearly ranked with owners and deadlines  

## Red Flags (Escalate to gap-question-generator)
- Compliance framework applies but no assessment provided (incomplete)
- Compliance violation with no remediation path identified (show-stopper risk)
- Required evidence not obtainable before target cutover date

## Implementation Notes
- Use 00-governance.md scope classification to determine change control requirements
- Reference industry standards (GDPR, SOX, GxP) for applicable frameworks
- Identify sign-off owners from stakeholder list in 10-project-context.md
- Mark items "REQUIRES REVIEW" if uncertainty exists - don't assume compliance
- Set specific deadlines for remediation actions - these block go-live
