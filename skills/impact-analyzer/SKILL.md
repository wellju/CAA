# impact-analyzer

## Purpose
Assesses the business and technical impact of the proposed change using a risk matrix, system dependency analysis, and user impact assessment.

## Input
- Normalized requirement from requirement-normalizer
- Open questions from gap-question-generator

## Process

### Step 1: Risk Identification

Identify risks across 5 dimensions:

**Technical Risks**:
- Performance degradation (volume impacts, complex queries)
- Data consistency issues (multi-system synchronization)
- Integration failures (third-party system compatibility)
- Custom code breaking (ABAP compatibility in cloud migration)
- System stability (single points of failure, redundancy)

**Organizational Risks**:
- Change adoption (user training, workflow changes)
- Resource constraints (expertise, availability, capacity)
- Timeline slippage (competing priorities, complexity)
- Stakeholder misalignment (conflicting business goals)
- Knowledge gaps (new technology, vendor lock-in)

**Business Risks**:
- Revenue impact (transaction processing downtime)
- Compliance violations (regulatory requirements not met)
- Cost overruns (scope creep, resource needs)
- Process disruption (workflow breaks during transition)
- Data loss or leakage (security, privacy)

**Operational Risks**:
- Support readiness (training, documentation, runbooks)
- Rollback feasibility (can we undo this quickly?)
- Monitoring/alerting gaps (can we detect problems?)
- Vendor dependency (support SLAs, roadmap alignment)

**Strategic Risks**:
- Architectural debt (quick fix vs. sustainable design)
- Future extensibility (locked into single vendor/technology)
- Competitive disadvantage (delay vs. market window)
- Skills obsolescence (hard to hire for legacy tech)

### Step 2: Risk Scoring

For each identified risk:
- **Probability**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
- **Impact**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
- **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact = 1-9

### Step 3: Mitigation Strategy

For each risk score 4+:
- **Mitigation Strategy**: How we prevent or reduce this risk
- **Required Evidence**: What proof we need that mitigation worked
- **Owner**: Who is responsible
- **Timeline**: When mitigation actions must be complete

### Step 4: Systems Impact Analysis

For each system affected:
- **System Name**: [Name]
- **Type of Impact**: [Data model, integrations, performance, security]
- **Risk Level**: [Low / Medium / High / Critical]
- **Mitigation**: [How we manage this]

### Step 5: User Impact Assessment

For each user group:
- **User Group**: [Role, department, count]
- **Workflow Changes**: [What will be different]
- **Training Needs**: [What users need to learn]
- **Adoption Risk**: [Low / Medium / High]
- **Mitigation**: [Training approach, communication plan]

# Impact Analysis for CHG-2026-001

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Timeline |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|-------|----------|
| Performance degradation on month-end close | Medium | High | 6 | Load testing with production volume; index optimization; batch job tuning | SAP Architect | Week 4 of implementation |
| Custom ABAP code incompatibility with cloud | High | High | 9 | Code assessment; SAP CAP conversion; legacy feature wrapping | Dev Lead | Weeks 1-3 of implementation |
| Data migration data quality issues | Medium | High | 6 | Data cleansing project (CHG-2026-002); reconciliation automation; golden record creation | Data Lead | Before cutover |
| Integration failures with legacy systems | Medium | Medium | 4 | API standardization; error handling queues; monitoring automation | Integration Lead | Weeks 8-10 |
| User adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | 4 | Early training; super-user program; communication plan; incentives | Change Manager | Weeks 6-10 |
| Resource unavailability at peak phase | Low | High | 3 | Resource reservation; backup staffing; vendor contingency | PMO | Immediate |
| Regulatory compliance gap | Low | Critical | 3 | Compliance framework review; audit trail implementation; data residency confirmation | Compliance Officer | Week 2 |

**Summary Risk Score**: 9/9 (HIGH RISK - requires mitigation and executive oversight)

## Affected Systems

### System 1: SAP ECC 6.0 (Current)
- **Impact Type**: Being replaced; data extracted and transformed
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Live data must be frozen during migration window
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Parallel run for 1-2 weeks to validate
  - Clear cutover date communicated 30 days in advance
  - Rollback plan tested and ready

### System 2: Third-Party Legacy Accounting System
- **Impact Type**: Real-time integration via APIs
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Integration complexity unknown
- **Mitigation**:
  - Proof-of-concept integration completed before migration
  - Dedicated integration testing phase (2 weeks)
  - Fallback to batch file interface if real-time not feasible

### System 3: SAP Analytics Cloud (New)
- **Impact Type**: Reporting platform replacement
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Greenfield implementation
- **Mitigation**:
  - Staged reporting rollout (Finance first, then Supply Chain)
  - Training for report consumers

---

## User Impact

### User Group 1: Finance Department (50 users)
- **Workflow Changes**: 
  - Month-end close process redesigned (5 fewer manual steps)
  - Real-time GL inquiry replaces daily batch reporting
  - New approval workflow for journal entries
- **Training Needs**: 2-day workshop; job aids; super-user support hotline
- **Adoption Risk**: MEDIUM - Older demographic, slower to adopt
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Peer-to-peer mentoring program
  - Extra support hotline for first 30 days
  - Finance manager incentives for adoption metrics

### User Group 2: Supply Chain (200 users)
- **Workflow Changes**:
  - Purchase order creation simplified (system-guided)
  - Real-time inventory visibility (vs. batch updates)
  - New planning interface with AI recommendations
- **Training Needs**: 1-day workshop; online modules; sandbox practice
- **Adoption Risk**: LOW - Younger demographic, tech-comfortable
- **Mitigation**:
  - Gamification of sandbox practice
  - Early access for super-users (2 weeks before go-live)

### User Group 3: Sales (150 users)
- **Workflow Changes**:
  - Order entry unchanged (same UI maintained)
  - Backend credit check and fulfillment faster (2x)
  - New analytics available for opportunity management
- **Training Needs**: 0.5-day refresher; online module on new reports

## Performance Considerations

### Current State Volumes
- Daily POs: 500
- Daily Invoices: 200
- Daily Sales Orders: 1,000
- Master records: 500 customers, 10,000 materials

### Growth Projections
- Expected growth: 20% annually
- Projected volumes (Year 3): 1,200 POs/day, 240 invoices/day, 1,200 orders/day

### Performance Impact
- Month-end close currently takes 8 hours (5 days calendar)
- Target: 4 hours with cloud system automation
- Estimated gain: 1 day faster close, improved accuracy

### Optimization Strategy
- HANA in-memory processing for reporting (10x faster)
- Batch job optimization and parallelization
- Index tuning for high-volume master data queries
- API rate limiting and caching for integrations

---

## Data Considerations

### Master Data Affected
- **Customer Master**: 500 records; mapping to 3-way customer view (Bill-to, Ship-to, Payer)
- **Material Master**: 10,000 records; valuation method conversion (MAP → FIFO)
- **Vendor Master**: 1,500 records; payment terms normalization

### Volume Impacts
- 5-year transaction history: 250M line items (18GB in ECC, 2GB in HANA)
- Analytics repository: New capability not previously available
- Storage cost reduction: 60% on-premise storage vs. cloud-managed

### Migration Approach
1. Data quality cleansing (CHG-2026-002)
2. Mapping tables creation (2 weeks)
3. Test migration to dev/test (2 passes)
4. Final production cutover migration (4-hour window)
5. Post-migration reconciliation (3 days)
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - Risks identified from requirement analysis or domain knowledge  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output matches impact_analysis structure in output.schema.json  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - Risks with unknown probability or impact are flagged  
✅ **Gate: Risk Transparency** - Risks ranked by score and clearly prioritized  

## Red Flags (Escalate to gap-question-generator)
- Risk with unknown probability or impact (requires gap question)
- Mitigation strategy that's not feasible (raises scope question)
- User group adoption risk > MEDIUM without clear mitigation

## Implementation Notes
- Use 20-domain-knowledge.md for common risk patterns
- Use 00-governance.md for risk tolerance matrix (1-3 = Low, 4-6 = Medium, 7-9 = High, 9+ = Critical)
- Reference 30-architecture-decisions.md for architectural risks
- Calculate summary risk score as average of all individual risk scores
- Escalate to gap-question-generator if summary score > 6
