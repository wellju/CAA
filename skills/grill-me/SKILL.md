# grill-me

## Purpose
Conducts deep-dive Q&A sessions to clarify ambiguous requirements and surface hidden assumptions. Activated only when skill_requests includes "grill-me" in input.

## Input
- Normalized requirement from requirement-normalizer
- Open questions from gap-question-generator

## Process

### Step 1: Question Preparation

Prepare 15-20 probing questions designed to:
1. **Surface hidden assumptions** - What are we assuming that might not be true?
2. **Test scope boundaries** - What about edge cases and exceptions?
3. **Validate business drivers** - Is the ROI calculation realistic?
4. **Explore technical constraints** - Are there architecture limits?
5. **Identify stakeholder alignment** - Do all stakeholders agree on success?

### Step 2: Question Categories

**Category 1: Business Case Validation** (4-5 questions)
- How was the expected ROI calculated?
- What happens if the project runs 2x over budget?
- What is the financial consequence of delay?
- Who decided this was a strategic priority vs. other initiatives?
- What would cause us to cancel this mid-project?

**Category 2: Scope & Boundary Exploration** (4-5 questions)
- What would break if we didn't do [item]?
- What scenarios are we explicitly NOT addressing?
- Where is the boundary between "must have" and "nice to have"?
- If we had to cut 30% scope, what would stay and what would go?
- Are there any data elements or processes we didn't mention?

**Category 3: Technical Deep-Dive** (4-5 questions)
- What technology limitations could block this approach?
- What would change if we chose [alternative architecture]?
- What is the worst-case data migration scenario?
- If the vendor went out of business, how would we recover?
- What is our Plan B if the primary solution isn't feasible?

**Category 4: Organizational Readiness** (3-4 questions)
- Do all stakeholders truly agree on this direction?
- What organizational changes are required to make this successful?
- Who will resist this change, and why?
- Is the team equipped with the right skills?
- What happens to the team after go-live?

**Category 5: Risk Appetite** (2-3 questions)
- What is our tolerance for disruption during implementation?
- What risks would cause us to reverse course?
- How much contingency budget is available?
- What is unacceptable in a failure scenario?

### Step 3: Interview Facilitation

**Structure**:
- 60-90 minute session with key stakeholders (sponsor, technical lead, process owner)
- Ask each question and record detailed answers
- Probe for assumptions: "Why do you say that?" "What if that's not true?"
- Look for disagreement among stakeholders (sign of misalignment)
- Capture "aha moments" where assumptions are challenged

### Step 4: Output Generation

Generate "Deep-Dive Findings" document:

```markdown
## Grill-Me Deep-Dive Findings

### Category 1: Business Case Validation

**Q1: How was the expected ROI of $2.4M calculated?**

**Responses**:
- Sponsor: "Reduced infrastructure costs ($1.2M/year) + improved staff productivity ($600K/year) + avoiding legacy license fees ($600K/year)"
- Finance Director: "Infrastructure savings are validated from cloud vendor quotes, but productivity gains are aspirational - we don't have baseline data"

**Insight**: ROI is partially validated but contains $600K in unproven productivity assumptions. Recommend adding post-implementation measurement to validate.

**Recommendation**: Create KPI dashboard to track actual productivity gains post-go-live. If not realized within 12 months, launch targeted optimization initiative.

---

**Q2: What is the financial consequence if this project runs 2x over budget ($3M → $6M)?**

**Responses**:
- Sponsor: "We'd likely cancel mid-project. The business case breaks if we spend > $5M"
- Finance Director: "We have $3.5M in contingency budget available, so we could absorb up to $6.5M total"

**Insight**: Disagreement between sponsor and finance on budget tolerance. Sponsor thinks hard stop at $5M, but CFO has more flexibility.

**Recommendation**: Clarify budget ceiling with CFO and Sponsor jointly. Set clear escalation triggers (e.g., if at 70% budget with 30% scope remaining, escalate to sponsor).

---

### Category 2: Scope & Boundary Exploration

**Q3: If we had to cut 30% scope, what would stay and what would go?**

**Responses**:
- Process Owner: "We must keep FI and MM modules. We could defer reporting enhancements to Phase 2"
- IT Architect: "We must keep core integrations. We could defer API standardization"

**Insight**: Clear prioritization emerges - core financial processes > integrations > enhancements.

**Recommendation**: Formally document MoSCoW prioritization (Must have / Should have / Could have / Won't have) for CAB approval.

---

### Category 3: Technical Deep-Dive

**Q4: What is our Plan B if the primary cloud deployment isn't feasible?**

**Responses**:
- SAP Architect: "We don't have a Plan B. It's cloud or nothing"
- CIO: "If cloud fails, we could stay on ECC but that doesn't solve the business problem"

**Insight**: No viable alternative if cloud approach doesn't work. Single point of failure for entire initiative.

**Recommendation**: Develop contingency plan:
- Option B1: Extend on-premise ECC (costs $500K/year, delays modernization 3 years)
- Option B2: Hybrid approach (private cloud instead of public)

---

### Category 4: Organizational Readiness

**Q5: Do all stakeholders truly agree on this direction?**

**Responses**:
- Finance Director: "Fully supportive of cloud migration"
- Supply Chain VP: "Concerned about process disruption during cutover"
- IT Director: "Worried about cloud support model vs. on-premise support we're used to"

**Insight**: Surface-level agreement but underlying concerns. Supply Chain and IT have specific worries not addressed in original requirement.

**Recommendation**: 
- Schedule deep-dive with Supply Chain on cutover risk mitigation
- Schedule deep-dive with IT on cloud support model and SLAs

---

### Summary of Key Insights

**Assumptions Challenged**:
1. ROI contains $600K unproven productivity assumptions
2. Budget ceiling unclear between sponsor and finance
3. No Plan B if cloud approach doesn't work
4. Organizational alignment is surface-level (underlying concerns)
5. Cloud support model SLAs not evaluated

**New Questions Generated**:
1. How will we measure productivity gains post-go-live?
2. What is the hard budget ceiling ($5M or $6.5M)?
3. What is our contingency plan if cloud approach fails?
4. How do we address Supply Chain's cutover risk concerns?
5. What are cloud support SLAs vs. our current on-premise SLAs?

**Next Steps**:
1. Schedule follow-up sessions with concerned stakeholders (Supply Chain, IT)
2. Document KPI measurement plan for post-go-live validation
3. Clarify budget ceiling and escalation triggers with CFO/Sponsor
4. Develop contingency plans (Plan B options)
5. Evaluate cloud support SLAs vs. requirements

## Activation Logic

The grill-me skill activates only when:
```yaml
skill_requests contains "grill-me"
```

**Example Input**:
```json
{
  "change_id": "CHG-2026-001",
  "title": "S/4HANA Migration",
  "skill_requests": ["grill-me"]
}
```

## Quality Gates

✅ **Gate: Evidence Only** - All findings backed by stakeholder feedback  
✅ **Gate: Schema Compliance** - Output structured as optional module  
✅ **Gate: Explicit Unknowns** - Assumptions explicitly challenged  
✅ **Gate: Risk Transparency** - Disagreements and concerns surfaced  

## Implementation Notes
- Use when stakeholder alignment is unclear or assumptions are risky
- Conduct sessions with diverse stakeholder group (not just sponsor)
- Probe for disagreement - that's the signal of misalignment
- Generate follow-up questions for gap-question-generator
- Typical output: 5-10 deep insights + 3-5 new follow-up actions
